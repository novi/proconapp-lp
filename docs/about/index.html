				<p>* Documentation is governed by the Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0, a copy of which is attached below, and not by the other terms of this Microsoft patterns &amp; practices license.</p>

				<p>3. Conditions and Limitations</p>

				<p>(A) No Trademark License - This license does not grant you rights to use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.</p>

				<p>(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.</p>

				<p>(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are present in the software.</p>

				<p>(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including a complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with this license.</p>

				<p>(E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it. The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p>

				<p>(F) Platform Limitation - The licenses granted in section 2(A) extend only to the software or permitted derivative works that you create that run directly on a Microsoft Windows operating system product, Microsoft run-time technology (such as the .NET Framework or Silverlight), or Microsoft application platform (such as Microsoft Office or Microsoft Dynamics).</p>

				<p>(G) Binary Code Files - The software may include certain binary code files for which its source code is not included as part of the software, or that are packaged without the source code in an installable or executable package. As to these binary code files, unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you must comply with all technical limitations in those files that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not modify, work around any technical limitations in, or reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble these binary code files, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation.</p>

				<p>(H) Feedback - If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You also give to third parties, without charge, any patent rights needed for their products, technologies and services to use or interface with any specific parts of a Microsoft software or service that includes the feedback. You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.</p>
